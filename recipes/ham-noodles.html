<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Fans of Ponyo will remember Ponyo’s obsession with food, especially her love for ham.</p>
<p>The umami dish doesn’t have an official name, but it goes by a few monikers – such as ham noodles, Ponyo noodles, and Ponyo ramen. </p>
<p>Here’s how you can level up your instant noodles with just 2 ingredients</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 Packet of instant noodles</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>1 Slice of cooked ham</li>
<li>1 Egg</li>
<li>1 Green onion</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
<li>Boil water.</li>
<li>Transfer the boiling water into a saucepan. Add the egg and add more boiling water until the egg is fully submerged</li>
<li>Cover the saucepan with a lid and wait for about 8 minutes. Proceed to Step 5 in the meantime.</li>
<li>After 8 minutes, retrieve the hard-boiled egg, cut it into half, and set aside.</li>
<li>Chop green onion into bits.</li>
<li>Slice the ham into halves. Put both ingredients aside.</li>
<li>Add instant noodles in a bowl. Pour boiling water over the noodles and cover with a lid. Set aside for 3 minutes.</li>
<li>After the first minute, separate the noodles and add in ham, hard-boiled egg and green onion. Cover the ramen bowl with a lid again. </li>
<li>Wait for 2 more minutes and the dish is ready.</li>
